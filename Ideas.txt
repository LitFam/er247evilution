Pros:*consult local businesses that are up and coming(potentially dont have a lot of traffic or web presence, #of reviews)
	-Could potentially yield some ad revenue for us to fund the launch of the project
	-can yield exposure to struggling businesses, hard to find places, help users before even using the app
	-
Cons:*dont know what the app will look like
	-not sure how to exactly use Adsense or targeted ads 
	-potential concerns from a standpoint of privacy if the app has permission to access GPS/location services
	-Could end up leaving users with a negative outlook on the app as theymight be overwhelmed by advertisements.
	-Have to meet businesses owners in person, negotiate a deal that mutually benefits both parties
	-Makes a business demand certain results for their money if we only have a small app reach, may dissapoint app owners
